# MicroWeldr Configuration

[printer]
# Prusa Core One specific settings
bed_size_x = 250.0  # mm
bed_size_y = 220.0  # mm - Core One has 220mm Y axis
max_z_height = 270.0  # mm

[nozzle]
# Nozzle dimensions for animation visualization
outer_diameter = 1.1  # mm - effective nozzle diameter (plastic melting zone)
inner_diameter = 0.2  # mm - nozzle inner diameter (opening)

[temperatures]
bed_temperature = 35  # °C - safer temperature to reduce burn injury risk
nozzle_temperature = 160  # °C for normal welds - safer temperature to reduce burn injury risk
chamber_temperature = 35  # °C - Core One chamber temperature for plastic welding
use_chamber_heating = false  # Set to false to disable chamber heating (useful if sensor is not working)
cooldown_temperature = 50  # °C

# Temperature safety ranges for welding
min_safe_nozzle_temp = 100  # °C - minimum safe temperature for welding
max_safe_nozzle_temp = 250  # °C - maximum safe temperature to prevent damage
temp_tolerance = 10  # °C - allowed temperature deviation from target

[movement]
move_height = 5.0  # mm - height for safe movement
frame_height = 10.0  # mm - height for frame drawing (clearance check)
travel_speed = 3000  # mm/min - travel speed for movements
z_speed = 600  # mm/min - optimized Z speed (near maximum safe limit for Core One)

[normal_welds]
# Settings for black SVG elements
weld_height = 0.020  # mm - how low the nozzle goes for welding (20 microns, optimized compression)
weld_temperature = 160  # °C - safer temperature to reduce burn injury risk
weld_time = 0.1  # seconds - optimal from calibration test (first line, best results)
dot_spacing = 0.5  # mm - final desired spacing (double density, ~50% overlap with 1.1mm effective diameter)
initial_dot_spacing = 6  # mm - spacing for first pass (wider, 4x final spacing)
cooling_time_between_passes = 2.0  # seconds - time to let plastic cool

[frangible_welds]
# Settings for frangible welds (blue SVG elements)
weld_height = 0.020  # mm - same precision height for frangible welds (20 microns, optimized compression)
weld_temperature = 160  # °C - temperature for frangible welds
weld_time = 0.3  # seconds - shorter welding time
dot_spacing = 0.5  # mm - final desired spacing (double density, ~50% overlap with 1.1mm effective diameter)
initial_dot_spacing = 3.6  # mm - spacing for first pass (wider, 4x final spacing)
cooling_time_between_passes = 1.5  # seconds - time to let plastic cool

[output]
# Output file settings
gcode_extension = ".gcode"
animation_extension = "_animation.svg"

[sequencing]
# Weld sequencing algorithm settings
skip_base_distance = 5  # dots - for skip algorithm, print every Nth dot first

[animation]
# Animation timing settings for SVG output
time_between_welds = 0.1  # seconds - time between each weld point appearing
pause_time = 3.0  # seconds - how long pause messages are displayed
